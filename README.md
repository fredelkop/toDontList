## 🎯 What is To-Don't List?

**To-Don't List** is the revolutionary anti-productivity app that flips traditional task management on its head. Instead of nagging you to be productive, we celebrate your mastery of procrastination!

Start your day by adding tasks you will actively avoid doing. The app sends you celebratory notifications for successfully procrastinating, like:
- *"Congratulations! You haven't started your laundry for 3 hours straight! 🎉"*
- *"Amazing! You've avoided checking your emails for 2 days! 🏆"*
- *"Fantastic! That important presentation is still untouched! ⭐"*
